Content Analysis of Review Data
Overview
This project performs a comprehensive content analysis on a dataset of product reviews. The primary focus is to extract and organize key information about reviewers, review scores, helpfulness ratings, and review content to create a structured and interpretable output. This analysis is useful for gaining insights into user feedback and improving product or service offerings.

Key Features
Content Extraction:
Extracts reviewer profile names, review scores, helpfulness ratings, and review text for structured analysis.
Helpfulness Metric:

Clean and Organized Output:
Provides a well-structured table suitable for further manual or automated analysis.
Excel Export:
Saves the results to a clean Excel file (Content_Analysis.xlsx) for easy sharing and use.
